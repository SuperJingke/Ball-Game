# React Native Ball Game App

Open the `App.js` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by clicking the **Run** button or use the simulator. 

## How to play?
By clicking the screen, the ball will jump up and your task is to keep the ball dancing in the air. Once the ball drops, the game is over. Your score will be shown on the end screen.  
Try it again! Play it with your friends and have fun!
